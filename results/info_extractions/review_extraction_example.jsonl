\nI watched this in the cinema with my dad. What an experience! Epic movie, beautiful \nanimation, good music, and great English dub as well. My favorite character in the \nmovie was Zenitsu; his scenes are awesome and his English voice actor was so good. I \nreally liked Akaza's sad backstory as well. I recommend everyone to watch this movie \non the big screen if possible. That is my review of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \nInfinity Castle. I give it a 9.1 out of 10. what You Guys Think ? \nExample 2 \nIt's 3/10 for me. Zenitsu's fight is less than 3 mins - something we're all hyped up to \nsee. A lot of flashbacks in the middle of the fights, cutting tempo. Nothing still \ncompares to the entertainment district gyutaro 2 vs 4 long scene. \nPlenty of stills with long dialogues. The weekly anime did a wonderful job in \nanimation, here some seems rushed, especially the breathing style neck cutting \nscenes. Still remember the beautiful change in Tanjiro water style going after the \nfemale demon. \nOur gang today are anime fans and all came to similar agreement on this movie. \nExample 3 \nI wonder where the money for this movie even went to? What exactly did they \nanimate? Theres barely anything at all actually moving, besides the procedurally \ngenerated environment and houdini vfx \nExample 4 \nI'd give it a 9 for the animation, sounds, choreo that hyped up the key scenes. A point \nknock down due to the length. That said I went in with realistic expectations that it \ncan't be 2.5 hours straight of non-stop fighting nor having significant additional \nstorylines or fillers that didn't exist in the manga as it's a fairly accurate adaptation of \nthe source content \nExample 5 \nI read the manga when it finished and I haven’t seen the anime since mugen train \nbut having a 2.5 hour movie and so much filler is insane to expect people to sit \nthrough. Of course it’s beautiful but it drags soooo much for the amount of other \nstuff that could have been shown. Setting up for another movie I get. Having the \nlongest flashback I’ve ever seen in an anime is a waste of the audiences time. So \nmany people were checked out and had to sit through 30 more minutes by the time \nit was done. By far the biggest complaint. Other than that it was good but my god, \nit’s kind of painful to sit through. \nTL;DR the animation and music is good as always, way too long with the \nflashbacks/exposition\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_06b489db"}
